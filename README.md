# Tailwind CSS Bug: Dynamic Utility Classes and Unexpected Behavior

This repository demonstrates an uncommon bug encountered when using dynamically generated values within Tailwind CSS utility classes.  The issue primarily revolves around inconsistencies in applying styles when using variables to control class names, particularly with margin and padding.

## Bug Description

Dynamically assigning Tailwind CSS classes using JavaScript variables can lead to unexpected behavior.  The styles might not apply correctly, or errors may arise during the build process. This is especially true when using more complex or concatenated dynamic values.

## Reproduction Steps

1. Clone the repository.
2. Run `npm install` to install dependencies.
3. Run the application (`npm start` or equivalent).
4. Observe the inconsistent application of margin in the dynamic case.

## Solution

The provided solution uses a more robust approach to applying dynamic classes, ensuring the utility classes are correctly parsed and applied by Tailwind.  This ensures consistency, avoiding the issues that arise from unpredictable string concatenation.

## Note

This bug may be specific to certain versions of Tailwind or related dependencies.  Please specify the versions you are using for better support and reproduction.
