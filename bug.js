  <p>I encountered a strange issue where using arbitrary values (like those generated dynamically) within Tailwind's utility classes caused unexpected rendering behavior.  For instance, attempting to dynamically set a margin using a variable didn't always work as expected.</p>
  <p>Example:</p>
  <p>Let's say I have a variable: <code>let dynamicMargin = 'mb-10';</code></p>
  <p>And I try to apply it to an element like this:</p>
  <pre><code class="language-html">&lt;div class={"`bg-gray-200 p-4 ${dynamicMargin}" }&gt;This div has a dynamic margin.&lt;/div&gt;</code></pre>
  <p>While this often works, sometimes the margin doesn't apply correctly, or it throws an unexpected error during build/render, especially with more complex dynamic values.</p>
</div>
